Credit Note and Refunds
=======================

A credit note, or credit memo, is a document issued to a customer that notifies them that they have been credited a certain amount.

There are several reasons that can lead to a credit note, such as:

* a mistake in the invoice
* a return of the goods, or a rejection of the services
* the goods delivered are damaged

.. note:: Issuing a credit note is the only legal way to cancel, refund or modify a validated invoice. Donâ€™t forget to register the payment afterward if you need to send money back to your customer.

Credit Note and Refunds
=======================

A credit note, or credit memo, is a document issued to a customer that notifies them that they have been credited a certain amount.

There are several reasons that can lead to a credit note, such as:
**a mistake in the invoice**
**a return of the goods, or a rejection of the services**
**the goods delivered are damaged**
